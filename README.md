# VeriVerse – SMS Hackathon Project

**A decentralized mobile marketplace built on Solana – where users trade freely, post freely, and own everything.**

## 🌍 Project Overview

VeriVerse is a dual-layer platform:
- 🏛 Centralized Trust Engine – Email/phone login, moderation, fiat UX
- 🛸 Decentralized Freedom Layer – Wallet-only login, unstoppable posts, peer-to-peer trade

At the Solana SMS Hackathon, we are building the **Freedom Layer** — a mobile-first dApp powered by Solana Mobile Stack.
